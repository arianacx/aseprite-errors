This is a not a guide to compile Aseprite but a guide on how to solve main issues when trying to compile it.

# ninja aseprite
error: 'ninja' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
solution: create a path create a C:\Ninja path instead of C:\Ninja\ninja.exe (also, delete the C:\Ninja\ninja.exe path previously created)
some online tutorials say to create a path C:\Ninja\ninja.exe, whilst it can work for some, if encountering errors with the system's navigation/localization/readability, just try C:\Ninja instead
